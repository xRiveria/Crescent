Crescent is the culmination of my very first foray into the world of custom engines. I tried out anything and everything I could before discovering an interest in graphics and editor tooling, 
which is why you will find OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX12 and a half-baked RHI (Render Hardware Interface) all stuffed into this project.

While I've since moved on to more structured and advanced engines, Crescent serves as a personal nostalgic trip down memory lane.
